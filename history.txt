==========================
major
- added user setting to ignore filtering of own changes in recent changes lists.
- Fixed bug #6574 (New install failing on "add db_version entry").
- Rewrote ListBlockCol_DaysLeft class and enabled it by default.
- Added "blocked" and "my blocked" filters to task list in home.
- Modified project list's page actions to have provide option to create new
  project from scratch or from a template.
minor
- fixed render wiki bug when link with pipe above table.
- fixed several minor typos.
- checked for missing iconf-function when exporting csv.
- added LICENSE and COPYRIGHT files which were missing for some reason.
- Fixed two spelling errors and updated translation files:
  . "plattform" -> "platform" 
  . "upcomming" -> "upcoming"
- Fixed bug where if you had permission to see everything you'd still not be able to
  view companies that had projects which you were assigned to. Furtermore, if a
  company has projects you are assigned to but more than one then it would give a bug error -
  changed it to report insufficient permissions instead until we properly implement it.
- SQL errors on install will print out the line number the error occurs to help debug.
- A number of fixes/minor enhancements to install script.
- Updated install/install.php to not produce unsightly error when no write permissions to
  tmp files directory and a few other trivial improvements to pre-req checking.
- If reinstalling, instead of doing nothing lets rewrite the database settings. Otherwise,
  if you delete them config files (db one specifically) then you have to regenerate it
  yourself or drop the database.
- Set default company category to client when creating a new company.



version: v0.0803 [2008-05-09]
==========================
major
- added is_news option to tasks / topics
- added project options to hide features like tasks and file uploads
- fixed table-rendering bug (http://www.streber-pm.org/5217)
- Added "ASAP" option to mail notifications which will result in mail 
	notifications being sent out for individuals everytime the sendNotifications
	function is called when they have their notification interval set to "ASAP".
	Site admins can create a cron job to visit index.php?go=triggerSendNotifications
	at regular intervals.
- Made db-version detection more robust.
- Fixed bug where two entries of db-version would be inserted on install.
- Fixed bug where error would result if correct schema file is available.
- Disabled profile selection drop down if user being edited is the
	automatic user created at install time. This should prevent situations
	like in bug #6105 (unless existing install already has deleted but we
	can't do much about that ;]).
- Added more options to the install process and changed order of questions. 
	Site name (sets APP_NAME) and Admin's email (sets ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL). 
	New options will be installed to _settings/site_settings.php
- Changed default conf value for MESSAGE_WELCOME_HOME, replacing streber with 
	%s. Updated index.php and pages/login.inc.php to replace string token with
    APP_NAME conf.
- Updated pages/login.inc.php to use APP_NAME conf instead
    of the constant "streber". 
- Added new permission, RIGHT_PERSON_GRANT_ACCT which allows you to set the 
	"can login?" bit on a user. By default, if you have the ability to create a
	user you also have the ability to edit a user so I made it the default that
	if you can create/edit a user, you can also grant them an account 
	(ie. login). This allows admins to allow people to "really" setup new 
	accounts without giving them the permissions to edit people's rights 
	(which you required before).
